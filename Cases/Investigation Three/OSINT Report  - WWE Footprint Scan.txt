  - Fake DM screenshots and AI generated videos 
  - Impersonation profiles -> scammers use private dm scam
* Many wrestlers have inconsistent usernames across platforms.

G. NARRATIVE MANIPULATION:
Wrestling fans are emotionally reactive; misinformation spreads fast.
High-risk patterns:
- Fake injury reports
- Fake contract “leaks”
- Stolen backstage images repurposed with false claims
- Bot amplification during scandals
* If the goal is to create a new version of kayfabe where deception is implemented. Then a happy medium would be a long term sucess. 

H. SOCIAL ENGINEERING ANGLES:
- Public calendars for tour dates provide predictable schedules.
- Public-facing staff (marketing, PR, interns) often have exposed LinkedIn emails.
- Fake sponsorship requests can be used to target talent or staff.

6. RISK ASSESSMENT:
WWE maintains a mature digital footprint with strong infrastructure and multi-platform control. Its biggest vulnerabilities are talent, fans, overexposure of social media.
